# MyBands

Hello, I have done this app and I know that this is just a first version.
The idea is to create an app that allow any type of music band to organize rehearsals, playlists, songs, etc.

1) To start you can use the user:fer@mana.com passw:123456 and then create your own user and start interacting with the app.

2) Once you are logged in, you need to create a band or wait for a band invitation to join.

3) Create a band. Go to My Bands, Create Band.

3) My bands, you can select here the band where you would like to intarct in case you belong to more than one. With click you select the band, with long click you can update it.

4) To invite a musician to your band, go to Find Musician and select one an send a request. Then if you log out and login as that invited musician, the first thing you will see is that you have an invitation to accept or decline.

5) Once you added musicians, you can go to Band Members and send messages.

6) Quit band is for that.

7) Once you belong or create a band, you will be able to add Songs. Go to Songs, and you can write name and artist or band and also click in youtube button to associate a video to that song.

8) Into My Songs you can see which songs belong to your band, and you can see the video if they have one and you can only delete or modify a song if you added it.

9) After create songs, you can create Playlists and associate songs to a particular Playlist and also you can see the video links, and modify Playlist name and content.

10) Finally you will be able to create an event, that could be a Rehearsal or a Concert. You have to select the date, time and place from the right buttons. And then you will see the events in your MainActity and you will only see the next ones from Today. You can also modify or delete any event and also if you click the event you can see a little map showing the location.

I hope you like it and I will wait for your feedback.

Thanks for this opportunity, I have learned a lot and I would specially like to thank Prasad S, he was amazing always availabe when I needed help.
