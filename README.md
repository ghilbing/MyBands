# MyBands

Hello, I have done this app and I know that this is just a first version.
The idea is to create an app that allow any type of music band to organize rehearsals, playlists, songs, etc.

To start you can use the user:fer@mana.com passw:123456 and then create your own user and start interacting with the app.
Once you are logged in, you need to create a band or wait for a band invitation to join.

After you belong to a band, then you need to create songs and you can associate a 
youtube video to that song to see which cover the band would you like to play. 

Then you need to create Playlist and add these created songs to a particular playlist.

After creating a playlist you can add an Event, that could be a Rehearsal or a Concert.

Then, in MainActivity you will see the next events and also these events are shown in the Widget.

I hope you like it and I will wait for your feedback.

Thanks for this opportunity, I have learned a lot and I would specially like to thank Prasad S, he was amazing always availabe to help.
